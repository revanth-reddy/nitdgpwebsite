            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">The Centre of Biomedical Engineering & Assistive Technology (BEAT) is focused on specific research to solve complex biomedical problems that are crucial to human welfare and society, in general. It invites /aims at multidisciplinary perspective that include engineering sciences, physical sciences mathematical, and biological sciences. This centre is determined to enhance interdisciplinary engineering education & research, training of paramedical and medical skills of personnel in the field /application. The thematic focus areas for research under the BEAT are 
              <ol type="i">
              <li>Biomaterials & Biofabrication</li> 
            <li>Biomechanics & Biomechanical Engineering</li> 
            <li>Biomedical Devices, Bio-Instrumentation & Bio-sensors</li>
            <li>Assistive Technology & Rehabilitation Engineering</li>
          </ol>

            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
              In the field of Biomedical Engineering & Assistive Technology, researchers are making attempts over the past several years from a selected pockets such as BETIC-IIT Bombay, IISc Banglore in national arena, demonstrated their productivity and have secured external funding for their research. But such activity in NITs systems is non-existent. At the same time, the field of biomedical engineering is different from bio-technology centers in different NITs or IITs as those only involve plant science or largely biological science oriented research. In this context, NIT Durgapur, having its numerous faculty members from different disciplines with a wealth of talent and knowledge in various areas of biomedical and rehabilitation robotics research wishes to establish a Centre for Biomedical Engineering and Assistive Technology (BEAT) that will provide an atmosphere in the Institute to expand their research, and attract talented postgraduate students and research scholars.  There is a compelling need to solve complex social and biomedical problems that are crucial to human welfare and society in general and that requires more broadly trained scientists with multidisciplinary perspectives that include engineering sciences, physical sciences, mathematical, and biological sciences.  Accordingly, Biomedical Engineering & Assistive cum Rehabilitation Technology Centre will be dedicated to interdisciplinary engineering education, research, training of paramedical and medical skills of the country.

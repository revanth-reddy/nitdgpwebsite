          <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
            In the wake of environmental concerns and the global uproar about rapidly-declining reserves of fossil fuels the development of alternative fuels is crucial for the sustenance and development of human civilization. Climate change, pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems, and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures. Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases. Climate-disrupting fossil fuels are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy. Today, renewables are seen not only as sources of energy, but also as tools to address many other pressing needs, including: improving energy security; reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy; mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; improving educational opportunities; creating jobs; reducing poverty; and increasing gender equality. Renewables have entered the mainstream.

      <div style="background-color: #001333;color: #fff;padding: 10px;text-align: center;">About the Centre </div>
          <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
            Due to the growing environmental concerns and depleting reserves of fossil fuels along with their expensive extraction and processing, more emphasis is being laid on finding alternative fuels which are non-polluting and renewable/abundant. Solar energy, being the most abundant of the renewable energy sources, is being sought after to cater to the increasing global power demand in order to minimise environmental damage. The average solar power received by the earth's surface stands at 173000 terawatts. This enormous amount of energy can act as source of energy if we can successfully convert and store it as electrical energy as per our requirement. One can achieve this by photovoltaic devices which are capable of converting the solar photons into electrons to creative a current or can hydrolyse water (another abundant resource) by the means of a photo-catalyst through photo-elctro-chemical water splitting. Both these approaches have enormous potential as alternative and renewable energy technology for the future generation.
            In view of the above, and due to rapid urbanisation of Indian economy, the demand for alternative energy has been ever increasing in India. Durgapur being an industrial city, and due to Govt. of Indiaâ€™s look east policy, need for developing technologies that can provide energy in a sustainable way for long term economic growth of the eastern India, it is high time that researchers at NIT Durgapur, take proactive role in transforming this growth process within the region. It is with these objectives, that a group of researchers as underlined below from a number of departments of NIT Durgapur, a premier technological institute, have come together to work jointly to develop technologies that can contribute significantly to the sustainable growth of the eastern region of India.

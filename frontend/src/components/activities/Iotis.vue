            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">The mission of the Centre of excellence for 'Advanced Research on IoT and Intelligent Systems' is to study, explore, design, develop, and study reliable, scalable and self-organized networks and systems leading to ubiquitous computing that offers an inclusive, sustainable and caring ambiance for living.  In recent years, we’ve all been hearing a lot about smart cites, smart homes and the Internet of Things (IoT).  We live in a world where Internet connectivity and smart phone ownership is near ubiquitous. Underlying and complementing these factors is the IoT. Now a days, we are surrounded by hundreds of smart but possibly ‘passive’ (lacks sufficient intelligence) devices and are able to enjoy mere ubiquitous connectivity among them. The journey ahead towards ‘smart space’ in true sense is possible only if, at first, we can convert millions of these passive pervasive devices to ubiquitous intelligent ‘smart objects’ which are able to sense locally in real-time, take decision independently (or in coordination) and act effectively to partially take over complex human perceptive & cognitive functions. Secondly, seamlessly integrate their collective pervasive intelligence to act unnoticeable in the background to achieve a desired task as a unified system. Presently at NIT Durgapur, we have many faculty members from different Departments with a wealth of knowledge and potential in various areas of IoT and Machine learning.  Over the past several years these researchers have continually demonstrated their productivity through their ability to publish in scientific journals, actively participate in national and international conferences, and secure external funding for their research.  NIT Durgapur is now in a position to establish a centre for IoT and Machine Learning that will provide a dynamic environment for faculty to expand their research and attract talented postgraduate students and research scholars.  There is a compelling need to solve complex social and biomedical problems that are crucial to human welfare and society in general and that requires more broadly trained scientists with multidisciplinary perspectives that include engineering sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and biological sciences.

            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
              The proposed ‘Centre of Excellence for Advanced Research on IoT and Intelligent Systems’ (IoTIS) will focus on advanced interdisciplinary research activities in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) and assistive technologies related to Intelligent Systems to cater to the needs of the society. Another goal of IoTIS is to meet the challenges of the nation by encouraging research and entrepreneurship in interdisciplinary areas, encompassing engineering, sciences, and social sciences. IoTIS also aims to reach out to universities, research institutions and industrial organizations with periodic continuing-education programs for proper utilization of national resources. As far as academic programs are concerned, the centre will be offering Masters, and PhD programs in Advanced Networking and Intelligent Systems. Going forward, the centre seeks collaboration with national and international institutes and partnership with social institutions and industries to realize its goals.

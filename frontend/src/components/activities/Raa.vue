            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
    	         Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA) is an initiative of the Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) to popularize science, mathematics and technology among school students. While emphasising the primacy of the schools and classroom transactions, the RAA aims to leverage the potential for science, mathematics and technology learning in non-classroom settings. Beyond the four walls of a classroom, opportunities for science, mathematics and technology learning abound. Accordingly, the RAA is planned to provide nourishing and nurturing support to and a platform for schools in a dual track approach to make Science, Mathematics and Technology exciting to children and encourage them to have an enduring interest both inside classroom and outside classroom activities. The objectives of this RAA programme is (i) to enable children to become motivated and engaged in Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT) through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, rational reasoning, testability etc. (ii) to create curiosity, excitement and exploration among school children in Science, Mathematics and Technology. (iii) to create a culture of thinking, inventing, tinkering and doing to promote enquiry based learning in Schools. RAA will target students in the age group of 6-18 years and in turn the execution of RAA will span across MHRD’s schematic interventions of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in the Department of School Education & Literacy and programmes and schemes of Department of Higher Education to encourage Science, Mathematics & Technology. NIT Durgapur is a mentoring institute along with IIT Kharagpur and IISER Kolkata for RAA for the state of West Bengal. In collaboration with Govt. of West Bengal, Paschim Banga Samagra Shiksha Mission, NIT Durgapur prepare a plan for promotion of science and mathematics among the school students of the state of West Bengal.

            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
              NIT Durgapur already established a small science museum in its campus to facilitate the experimental facilities for the school kids of Durgapur city and nearby remote villages. The museum is equipped with various school level experiments relating to physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology and geology. The biology section has display of human skeleton, taxidermy of lizards, snakes, shark etc. cross section of starch under microscope etc. Geology section includes display of different fossils, rocks and minerals along with their composition. Physics section has interesting experiments such as fundamental experiments on optics, magnetism, electricity and electronics. The museum also explore about basic experiments on the environmental science and weather science (weather monitoring system). Chemistry section consists of basic experiments on forensic science and many more. The science museum has a telescope to view the night sky. Achraya Prafulla Chandra Science Museum was inaugurated on November 11, 2018 by R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, MHRD, Govt. of India and Shri K. Ananthkrishnan, Executive Vice President and CTO, TCS. Altogether 40 school students and 8 school teachers from various schools such as Nutandanga High School, Andal Village High School, DAV Model School, Durgapur, Pravananda Vidya Mandir, Durgapur, Guru Teg Bahadur Public School, Durgapur Vidyasagar Model School, DICV Public High School, Sagarbhanga High School, Durgapur RE College Model School, Bidhanngar Govt. Sponsored Girls’ High School, Sagar Bhanga High School, Bidhannagar Govt. Sponsored Boys’ High School, Nadiha Bribhanpur High School, Bihari More Education Project participated in this programme. These students displayed 15 models developed by them.

            <div style="border: 2px solid #001333;padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">
              Moreover, NIT Durgapur along with Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancha developed few portable low cost experimental kit for school level experiments on basic sciences. 20 low cost experimental kit have been developed by Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancho. This includes the experiments and model of basic science such as existence of air pressure, surface tension, reflection and refraction of light, advection and diffusion, Torricelli’s experiments, bouncy, combustion process requires oxygen etc.

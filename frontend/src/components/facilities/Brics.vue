              Recently NIT Durgapur steps into the BRICS Research forum. BRICS is composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and accounts for 26.46% of the world territory and 42.58% of the world population. Based upon 10 years' development, BRICS, as an mportant platform for emerging markets and developing countries, has evolved into an important driving force to global economic growth and trade cooperation, as well as to global economic governance reform. BRICS countries are important players in science and technology competition on the world arena, and they would facilitate their domestic STI development with the multilateral platform. The MOU on STI Cooperation adopted in 2015 is guiding overall cooperation covering sustainable agriculture, food security, natural disasters, water resources and pollution treatment, new and renewable energy, energy efficiency, space research, geospatial technology, medicine and life sciences, new materials and nanomaterials, photonics, information and communication technology, ocean and polar sciences, etc.

              BRICS Network Universities (BRICS NUs) was developed in the BRICS 7th summit in Russia in July 2015, under a Russian proposal of the establishment of BRICS NU, which was written into Ufa Declaration. The International Thematic Group (ITG) purpose is to develop theoretical and practical knowledge about water resources and the methods of pollution treatment. In particular, the ITG is aimed at:
              <ol>
                <li>developing joint educational and professional training programs on protection of water resources and pollution treatment tailored to the BRICS countries;</li>
                <li>conducting research on the formation of water resources and the origin of groundwater and surface water composition in the BRICS countries;</li>

              <p>Recently three faculty members from Department of Physics, Department of Civil Engineering and Department of Chemical engineering at NIT Durgapur started a joint research projects on Water Pollution treatment with some premier universities of Russia and China under BRICS STI Framework. The research group focused on the degradation of organic pollutants from industrial wastewater of Durgapur area using advance oxidation process, photocatalytic membrane reactor. Foreign collaborations may facilitate to open up a new avenue for the researchers of NIT Durgapur in the wastewater treatment technology.</p>
              <p>Researchers from NIT Durgapur is working on water management and pollution treatment for quite sometime. Different faculty members, Research Students, M. Tech and B. Tech students of various department of NIT Durgapur such as Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Earth and Environmental Studies, Computer Science and Engineering, Biotechnology and Physics join hands to work on the burning issue on water management and pollution treatment. NIT Durgapur is also going to launch Center for Environment and Water (CREW). This center will provide opportunity to the researchers of NIT Durgapur and its associates to work together in the field of Water and Environmental research such environmental radioactivity monitoring, air pollution, soil pollution, wastewater treatment using biological process and membrane process and many more.</p>
              <p>A group of researchers from department of Physics, Civil Engineering,computer science and engineering and Chemical engineering along with CDAC,Kolkata are also planning for new arena of research on sensor based automated water management system of the river Damodar. This may facilitate towards proper allocation and utilization of water for the agriculture sectors, industries and municipal corporations of under the Asansole Durgapur Development Authority as well as three districts of West Bengal – Purba Bardhaman, Paschim Bardhaman and Bankura.</p>
